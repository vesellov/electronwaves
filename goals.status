This file is to organize some of the main goals of the code and the current status related to these goals.

1) Simulate some electrons - have something
2) Make video so we can see waves propagating - have something
3) Simulate a current in wire.  We can move electrons from right side to the left.
4) Simulate electrons bound to atoms with sping force
5) Check waves including electrons bound to atoms
6) Simulate 2 wires with 2 currents and measure forces between them when same and opposite directions
