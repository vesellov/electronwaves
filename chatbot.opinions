I find it interesting to see what different chatbots opinions of this 
project are.   So I have given them promps like this one and then
recorded some of the ansers below.

Sample Prompt:
In some situations you can use special relativity to convert a problem 
with a magnetic field to one with just an electric field.  It has a 
"electromagnetic field tensor" that combines both electric and magnetic 
fields.  Some have said that magnetism can be derived from electrostatics 
and special relativity.  It makes me think that maybe the magnetic field 
is just the result of speed of light delay on moving electric fields.  I 
am writing a computer simulation, which makes use of powerful GPUs, that 
models electrons with propagation delayed coulombic forces to test this 
idea.  My tests indicate that today's high end GPUs now have enough power 
to handle this complex simulation.  My hope is that the "magnetic forces" 
will just emerge from my careful simulation of moving and delayed 
electrostatic forces.  I think this is consistent with known physics but 
my simulation is not fully working yet.  If it works, I think it could be 
great as an educational and research tool.  Do you think this looks worth 
exploring with a good chance of success or do you know of anything that 
could definitely rule it out?

Your idea taps into a profound and well-established principle in physics, 
reflecting the interconnected nature of electricity and magnetism as 
described by Maxwell's equations and the theory of relativity. Indeed, one 
of the remarkable insights from relativity is that the electric and 
magnetic fields are different aspects of the same phenomenon, depending on 
the observer's frame of reference. This is encapsulated in the 
electromagnetic field tensor you mentioned, which combines the electric 
and magnetic fields into a single entity that transforms under changes in 
the observer's velocity.

The concept that magnetism can be viewed as a relativistic effect of 
moving electric charges is not just a theoretical speculation but is 
grounded in modern physics. This perspective arises from the Lorentz force 
and the way Maxwell's equations transform under special relativity. For 
instance, an electric current—a flow of electric charges—produces a 
magnetic field, which can indeed be understood as the relativistic effect 
of moving electric charges.

Simulating electrons with propagation-delayed Coulomb forces is an 
intriguing approach, especially as it might allow you to observe emergent 
magnetic effects from purely electrostatic interactions under relativistic 
conditions. Such a simulation could offer insights into how magnetic 
fields emerge from the motion of electric charges, potentially providing a 
pedagogical illustration of these concepts.

However, there are several challenges and considerations:

    Computational Complexity: Accurately simulating the interactions of 
electrons with time-delayed forces is computationally intensive, 
especially if you aim to capture the effects at relativistic speeds. The 
computational power of GPUs may alleviate some of these challenges, but 
the complexity of the problem should not be underestimated.

    Quantum Effects: At the scale of individual electrons, quantum 
mechanical effects become significant. Classical physics simulations may 
not capture phenomena like quantum entanglement or the wave-like nature of 
particles, which can be crucial for a complete understanding of 
electromagnetic interactions.

    Validation and Novelty: While the emergence of magnetic forces from 
your simulations would be fascinating, it's important to note that this 
concept is already supported by theoretical physics. Thus, the novelty 
might lie more in the method of demonstration and the insights into 
computational physics rather than in fundamentally new physics.

    Existing Literature: There's extensive theoretical and experimental 
support for the view of magnetism as arising from electric charges in 
motion. Any simulation should align with these established results. It's 
worth reviewing existing literature on computational electromagnetism, 
relativistic physics simulations, and quantum electrodynamics to guide 
your project and understand its potential contributions.

In conclusion, your simulation project is promising as an educational and 
exploratory tool in computational physics. It could vividly illustrate the 
relativistic origins of magnetic fields and offer valuable insights into 
the dynamics of electromagnetic interactions. However, aligning your 
expectations with the established frameworks of classical and quantum 
electrodynamics is crucial. As for definitive ruling out, the key would be 
ensuring your simulation accurately reflects the principles of relativity 
and electromagnetism as we understand them. Pursuing this project could 
deepen understanding and appreciation of these fundamental concepts in 
physics, provided it's approached with an awareness of the theoretical and 
computational challenges involved.

Your idea of exploring the relationship between electric and magnetic 
fields through computer simulations is quite interesting and indeed 
grounded in known physics. The concept of magnetism arising from the 
relativistic effects of moving electric charges is a fundamental aspect of 
electromagnetism.

In fact, the unification of electric and magnetic fields into a single 
electromagnetic field, as described by the electromagnetic field tensor in 
special relativity, does suggest that magnetic fields can be seen as a 
consequence of electric fields and the finite speed of light. This is 
further supported by the fact that a purely electric field in one 
reference frame can appear as a combination of electric and magnetic 
fields in another frame moving relative to the first.

Your approach of modeling electrons with propagation-delayed Coulombic 
forces to observe the emergence of "magnetic forces" is a clever way to 
investigate this concept. If successful, your simulation could provide 
valuable insights and serve as an excellent educational and research tool.

However, it's important to keep in mind that while the idea is 
theoretically sound, the practical implementation of such a simulation can 
be challenging. Accurately modeling the relativistic effects and the 
propagation delay of electric fields requires careful consideration of 
various factors, such as the discretization of space and time, the 
handling of boundary conditions, and the numerical stability of the 
simulation.

Additionally, while modern GPUs offer significant computational power, the 
complexity of the simulation and the required level of precision may still 
pose challenges in terms of computational resources and simulation time.

Despite these potential challenges, your approach is definitely worth 
exploring. Even if the simulation doesn't perfectly reproduce all aspects 
of electromagnetic phenomena, it can still provide valuable insights and 
contribute to our understanding of the relationship between electric and 
magnetic fields.

I don't see any fundamental reason that would definitively rule out the 
success of your simulation. However, it's important to approach the 
project with a clear understanding of the limitations and approximations 
involved in the simulation and to interpret the results accordingly.

If you proceed with this project, I recommend starting with simple 
scenarios and gradually increasing the complexity as you validate the 
simulation results against known theoretical predictions and experimental 
observations. Collaborating with experts in computational physics and 
electromagnetism could also be beneficial in refining your approach and 
interpreting the results.

Overall, your idea is theoretically grounded and has the potential to 
provide valuable insights. While success is not guaranteed, the 
exploration itself can be a rewarding learning experience and contribute 
to our understanding of electromagnetic phenomena.

Your idea is indeed valid and aligns with the principles of special 
relativity and electromagnetic theory. The concept of deriving magnetism 
from electrostatics and special relativity is an established idea in 
physics. As you mentioned, the electromagnetic field tensor combines both 
electric and magnetic fields into a single entity, and magnetic forces can 
be viewed as a relativistic consequence of electrostatic forces.

The approach you are taking with your simulation is similar to what is 
known as a "retarded potential" formulation in electrodynamics. This 
formulation considers the finite speed of light and the resulting time 
delay in the propagation of electric and magnetic fields. This delay in 
the Coulomb interaction between charged particles can indeed lead to 
magnetic-like interactions in a relativistic framework.
Regarding the feasibility of your simulation, using modern GPUs for such 
computations can be very effective due to their parallel processing 
capabilities. As long as you carefully account for the retarded potentials 
in your calculations, there is a good chance that you will observe 
emergent magnetic forces in your simulation.

To the best of my knowledge, there have been other simulations exploring 
this concept, especially in the realm of plasma physics and 
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. However, your project sounds like a 
valuable contribution to the educational and research community. By 
providing an accessible and clear demonstration of how magnetic forces can 
emerge from relativistic electrostatic interactions, you can help deepen 
our understanding of electromagnetism and its underlying principles.

In conclusion, your project is worth exploring, and there is no definitive 
reason to rule it out. Your work could provide valuable insights and serve 
as a helpful educational and research tool for understanding 
electromagnetism and special relativity.
